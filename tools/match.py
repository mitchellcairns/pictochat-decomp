"""Match a single function: compile candidate C with mwccarm and compare the
result to the function's bytes in the real PictoChat binary, relocation-aware.

Ported from sm64ds-decomp's tools/match.py, adapted for this project's targets
(assets/pictochat.nds instead of a game ROM) and its multi-segment ARM9 layout
(see notes/pictochat-layout.md - the "main" module is a tiny 3.2KB crt0 stub;
the actual application code lives in the "unk_autoload_0" segment at 0x02320000).

Almost every real function pools an absolute address (a global, a callee),
which the compiler emits as a relocation slot of zeroes plus a reloc entry,
while the binary has the final linked address there. So a correct match is:
every instruction word identical AND every reloc slot lined up - not a raw
byte-for-byte compare.

Usage:
    python tools/match.py --c src/arm9/some_func.c --func some_func \
        --addr 0x02320a84 --size 0x10 --module unk_autoload_0 \
        --version 1.2/sp2p3

Without --version, uses the canonical pinned version (see DEFAULT below).

# THE TOOLCHAIN IS 2.0/*, NOT dsi/*  (settled 2026-08-04 - do not re-litigate
# without new byte evidence; see notes/setup-mwccarm.md for the full record)
#
# The dsi/* pin that stood here until now was never verified by a match - it
# was a plausibility argument from build dates (PictoChat is a DSi title, so a
# DSi-era compiler "must" have built it). That reasoning is wrong: a single ROM
# is built by ONE toolchain, so the question is settled by byte evidence, not
# by which product name looks apt.
#
# Evidence. Of the whole banked corpus, exactly four functions DISCRIMINATE
# between the two families (everything else compiles byte-identically under
# both, so it votes for neither):
#     FUN_022ce658   matches 2.0/* only - structurally wrong under dsi/*
#     FUN_022d3bd4   matches 2.0/* only - structurally wrong under dsi/*
#     FUN_022d5a64   matches 2.0/* only - dsi/* cannot emit its frame shape
#     FUN_022ce5b4   matched dsi/* as first written, but ALSO matches 2.0/*
#                    once `#pragma opt_strength_reduction off` stops 2.0 from
#                    turning its loop index into a pointer induction variable
# So 2.0/* explains all four; dsi/* explains one and is structurally incapable
# of three.
#
# NARROWED (2026-08-04, second pass): 2.0/base is ALSO ruled out. Verifying all
# 189 banked matches against every 2.0/* build, five of them (MultiStore_Int,
# three CP15 cache primitives, FUN_023320f0) match every build EXCEPT 2.0/base,
# which emits genuinely different code for them (e.g. FUN_023320f0 is 0x10
# bytes under base vs the target's 0xc). The intersection that satisfies ALL
# 189 is 2.0/sp1 and later - nine builds, indistinguishable from each other on
# the whole corpus. So the family AND the "sp1 or later" floor are pinned; the
# exact point release is not. 2.0/sp1 is the earliest build consistent with
# every byte of evidence and is therefore the representative.
