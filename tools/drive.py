"""Work a worklist with an LLM over an API key, compiling and byte-checking every attempt.

This is the driver tangOS Console runs for a keyed agent. It reads the worklist Console's
scheduler produced, and for each target: shows the model the ROM's disassembly and target
bytes, asks for C, compiles it, and compares against the ROM. A miss comes back with the
actual instruction diff so the next attempt is informed rather than a re-roll.

Nothing here banks anything. It writes a results file; tools/land.py re-verifies every claim
independently and decides what reaches src/. A driver that lies (or is simply wrong about a
size) must not be able to land a file, so the byte gate runs twice on purpose.

Configuration comes from the environment, matching what Console sets for an agent:
    GLM_API_KEY    the key
    GLM_BASE_URL   API root, e.g. https://api.anthropic.com
    GLM_MODEL      model id
    GLM_DIALECT    "openai" for /chat/completions; default is the Anthropic messages API

Usage:
    python tools/drive.py --wl worklist.jsonl --out results.json --jobs 1 --attempts 4
