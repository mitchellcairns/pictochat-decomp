"""CI-safe progress data generator: rebuild chaos-db.json from COMMITTED data only
(no ROM, no local extracted/, no ledger), so a GitHub Action can refresh it on every
push and the tangos.dev card / any viewer always shows current numbers.

Same shape as sm64ds-decomp's tools/chaos_db_ci.py, adapted to this repo's model:
  universe   config/{arm9,arm7}/symbols.txt  (name, module, addr, size - committed by
             tools/gen_symbols.py from the local Ghidra export; boundaries, no bytes)
  matched    a committed src/arm9|arm7/*.c[pp] carries a `// decomp: module=.. addr=..`
             marker (tools/ledger.py) for that function and is NOT parked `// NONMATCHING:`

  author     git history: the FIRST contributor to land the surviving match for each
             src file. Credit follows renames, so a later duplicate match or a mass
             rename does not steal it (login from users.noreply emails, else the
             email local-part, else the author name)

The `stats` block is the contract tangos.dev's romstats-sync reads: totalBytes,
matchedBytes, moduleCount, matchedFunctions (plus totalFunctions, generatedAt).

--contrib-out additionally writes contributions.json: matched-function count and
weighted match-coin count per contributor. That file is the input tangos.dev's match
coin ledger reads; it credits the DELTA between a published career total and what it
last paid, so this must be regenerated on every push to main and committed.

Until config/{arm9,arm7}/symbols.txt exists the universe is empty and only the matched
COUNT is meaningful - byte totals and the percentage need the symbols table.

Usage: python tools/chaos_db_ci.py [--out chaos-db.json] [--contrib-out contributions.json]

    first_matchers() credits whoever added a path first, which is wrong whenever that
    first version was an unmatched draft: the file only becomes countable once someone
    removes the banner, so the drafter would collect credit for someone else's match.

    A finish is identified by CONTENT, not by commit message: the path carried the
    NONMATCHING banner at some earlier point and does not at this commit. The FIRST such
    transition wins, so re-touching an already-matched file never transfers credit.

    This walks full history with per-path state rather than filtering diffs, because
    every diff-shaped approach misses cases:
      - `git log -- <path>` applies history simplification and silently prunes commits
        that arrived through a merge, so a match landing on a side branch is invisible.
      - the -G pickaxe lists only files whose own diff contains the pattern, so a newly
        added byte-matching file -- banner-free by definition -- is never reported.
    Draft state also has to follow a file across an extension change, which git records
    as a rename when the edit is small and as delete + add of the same stem when not.
